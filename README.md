# Febu

Fancy yet basically useless extensions for dart language, which lets you write more declaratively/functional code.

**All feedback is welcomed.**

## Getting started

Just add `febu` as dependency and start using it right away:

```dart

export 'package:febu/febu.dart';

final int two = 1.add(1); // 2
```

## Motivation

The main motivation is to create a set of reusable extension function that will bring everyday joy from language like
kotlin or javascript utilizing more declaratively/functional (yes I said it) code.

By being more declarative than imperative the final code will be in my opinion more readable and by that much cleaner.

Many of the function were inspired by kotlin language and functional javascript library [ramda](https://ramdajs.com/).

## Documentation

TODO (will be generated using dartdoc tool later)
