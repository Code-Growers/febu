# Febu

Fancy yet basically useless extensions for dart language, which lets you write more declaratively/functional code.

**All feedback is welcomed.**

## Getting started

Just add `febu` as dependency and start using it right away:

```dart

export 'package:febu/febu.dart';

final int two = 1.add(1); // 2
```

## Motivation

The main motivation is to create a set of reusable extension function that will bring everyday joy from language like
kotlin or javascript utilizing more declaratively/functional code.

By being more declarative than imperative the final code will be in my opinion more readable and by that a bit cleaner.

Many of the function were inspired by kotlin language and functional javascript library [ramda](https://ramdajs.com/).
